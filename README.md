Moon Landing Scene
In the second part of the Moon exploartion scene, the user is again inside the fighter jet. Here, we take a look at the moon and explore the rugged terrain while traversing in the jet. A kind of melancholy music plays as the the player is alone admid the the vastness of the dark, outer space. As we finishing traversing the moon, the ship turns around and the user sees the entirity of planet earth in their view. After a few seconds, the jet takes off in high speed to take a closer view of the earth.
